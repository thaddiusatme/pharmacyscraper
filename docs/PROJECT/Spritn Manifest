# Sprint X Manifest – “Search-Term Agnostic Refactor”

## Vision
Transform the pharmacy-centric scraper into a generic “business-data pipeline” that works for any search term / industry.

## Objectives
1. Abstract collection/classification layers so they accept arbitrary search terms.
2. Maintain existing pharmacy functionality as a plugin/example.
3. Preserve API-budget, caching, and test coverage guarantees.

## Key Deliverables
- Modular **EntityScraper** package (renamed or alias).
- Parameter-driven orchestrator accepting `business_type` config.
- Generic classification interface + per-domain plugins.
- Updated docs, examples, tests.

## Milestones
| # | Description | Owner | ETA |
|---|-------------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Core package rename / alias scaffolding |   |  |
| 2 | Orchestrator accepts `search_terms: []` |   |  |
| 3 | Generic rule-based classifier + plug-in hooks |   |  |
| … | … | | |

## Risks / Mitigations
- Breaking API for existing users → keep `pharmacy_scraper` shim.
- Wider search terms may raise API-cost → keep budget tracker, add per-term caps.
