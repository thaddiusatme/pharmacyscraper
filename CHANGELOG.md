# Project State

## Current Status
- **Environment**: ‚úÖ Set up and ready
- **Data Collection**:
  - Apify integration: ‚úÖ Implemented and tested
  - Raw data files: 52 CSV files in `data/raw/`
  - Processed data: 1,957 unique pharmacy records in `data/processed/combined_pharmacies.csv`
- **Verification**: ‚è≥ Pending implementation
- **Testing**: ‚úÖ Unit tests implemented for Apify integration
- **Documentation**: üìù In progress

## Next Steps
1. Configure Apify API token for production use
2. Generate list of major cities for comprehensive data collection
3. Run full data collection for all 50 states
4. Implement Google Places API verification
5. Create data validation and quality checks
6. Generate summary reports
7. Final verification and delivery preparation

## Data Statistics
- Total unique pharmacies: 1,957
- Data exceeds target (1,250 pharmacies) by 56.5%
- Data quality checks pending verification

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Core packages: pandas, requests, googlemaps, apify-client
- Development tools: black, flake8, pytest

## Configuration
- Environment variables required (see `.env.example`)
- Rate limiting: 50ms between API requests (configurable)
- Logging: Enabled with INFO level by default

## Notes
- All sensitive configuration is managed through environment variables
- Data processing logs are stored in `logs/`
- Final outputs will be saved in `reports/`
