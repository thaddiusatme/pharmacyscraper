    "explanation": "Mimikay Pharmacy is categorized simply as a pharmacy with no indication of affiliation to a major corporate chain or hospital system, nor is there mention of government or medical facility ties. The absence of 'compounding' in its name or categories suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy. Therefore, it fits the profile of an independent retail pharmacy."
