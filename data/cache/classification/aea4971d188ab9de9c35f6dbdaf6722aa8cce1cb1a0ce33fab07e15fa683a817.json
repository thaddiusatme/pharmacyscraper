    "confidence": 0.85,
    "explanation": "The listing for Jillien F. Hankewich, Bscpharm, shows a pharmacy category but no affiliation with any known chain or hospital system, and the name suggests an individual pharmacist rather than a corporate entity. There is no indication of compounding services in the name or categories, so it is classified as an independent pharmacy without compounding."
