    "explanation": "Freetown Pharmacy is categorized simply as a pharmacy with no indication of affiliation to a major chain or hospital system, nor any government or military association. The absence of 'compounding' in its categories or name suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy. Therefore, it fits the criteria of an independent retail pharmacy."
