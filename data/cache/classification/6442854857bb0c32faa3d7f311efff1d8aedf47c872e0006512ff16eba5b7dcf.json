    "explanation": "Portland Pharmacy is classified as an independent pharmacy because it does not appear to be part of a large corporate chain or affiliated with a hospital. The lack of specific chain or hospital indicators in its name or categories supports this classification. However, the confidence is not at its highest due to limited information about its ownership or affiliations."
