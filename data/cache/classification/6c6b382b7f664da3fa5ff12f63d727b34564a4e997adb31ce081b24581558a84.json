    "explanation": "Bascom Pharmacy appears to be an independent pharmacy as it is not listed as part of a major chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility. However, the confidence is not at its highest because the website link does not provide explicit information about its ownership or compounding services."
