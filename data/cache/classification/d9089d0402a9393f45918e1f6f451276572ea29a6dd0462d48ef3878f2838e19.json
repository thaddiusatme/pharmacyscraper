    "explanation": "AllCare Discount Pharmacy is classified as independent because it does not appear to be part of a major chain like CVS or Walgreens. However, its website is hosted by Erie Family Health, which could suggest some affiliation, but it does not explicitly indicate a hospital or chain status. There is no indication that it is a compounding pharmacy."
