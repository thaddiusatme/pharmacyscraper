    "explanation": "IMPERIAL PHARMACY appears to be a standalone retail pharmacy serving the general public with no indication of affiliation with a hospital, health system, or a major corporate chain. The website and category listing show it as a pharmacy but do not mention compounding services, so it is classified as an independent pharmacy without compounding."
