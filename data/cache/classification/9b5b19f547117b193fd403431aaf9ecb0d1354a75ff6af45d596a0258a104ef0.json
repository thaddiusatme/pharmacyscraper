    "explanation": "Price Chopper Pharmacy is likely part of a larger retail chain, as Price Chopper is a well-known grocery store chain. Although it is not one of the major national pharmacy chains like CVS or Walgreens, its association with a grocery store chain suggests it is not an independent pharmacy. There is no indication that it is a compounding pharmacy or affiliated with a hospital."
