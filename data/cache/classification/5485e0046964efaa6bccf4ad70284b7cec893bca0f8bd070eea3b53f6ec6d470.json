    "explanation": "Rodman's Discount Store is classified as an independent pharmacy because it does not appear to be part of a large corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility. However, the confidence is not at its highest because the name 'Discount Store' might suggest a broader retail focus, but it is listed as a pharmacy."
