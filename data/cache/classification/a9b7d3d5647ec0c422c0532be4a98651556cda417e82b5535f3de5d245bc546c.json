    "explanation": "Rockhill Pharmacy is a standalone retail pharmacy serving the general public without any indication of affiliation with a hospital, health system, government facility, or a major corporate chain. The website and categories list it simply as a pharmacy with no mention of compounding services, so it is classified as an independent pharmacy and not a compounding pharmacy."
