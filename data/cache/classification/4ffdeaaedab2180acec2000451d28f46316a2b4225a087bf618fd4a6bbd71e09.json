    "classification": "independent",
    "is_compounding": false,
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "explanation": "Belmar Pharmacy, formerly Custom Rx Pharmacy, appears to be a standalone retail pharmacy serving the general public without affiliation to a major chain or hospital system. Although the former name suggests some compounding services, the current listing and categories do not explicitly indicate compounding, so compounding is marked false with moderate confidence."
