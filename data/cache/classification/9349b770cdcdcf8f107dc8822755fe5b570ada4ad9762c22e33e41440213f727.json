    "explanation": "Century Pharmacy appears to be a standalone retail pharmacy serving the general public in New York City, with no indication of affiliation to a hospital, health system, or major corporate chain. The website and category listing show it as a pharmacy but do not mention compounding services, so it is classified as an independent pharmacy without compounding."
