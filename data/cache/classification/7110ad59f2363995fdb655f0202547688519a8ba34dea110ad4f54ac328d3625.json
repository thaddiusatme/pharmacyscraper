    "explanation": "Tricare Prime Pharmacy is affiliated with Tricare, a health care program for military members and their families, and its website is hosted on a .mil domain indicating a government/military medical facility. This aligns with a hospital or government-affiliated pharmacy rather than an independent or chain retail pharmacy. There is no indication it provides compounding services."
