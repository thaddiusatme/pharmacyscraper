    "classification": "independent",

    "explanation": "The pharmacy is named after an individual (Michael S. Anderson, DPH) without any indication of affiliation with a known corporate chain or hospital system. There is no mention of compounding services in the categories or name, and the address suggests a standalone retail location. Therefore, it fits the criteria of an independent pharmacy."
