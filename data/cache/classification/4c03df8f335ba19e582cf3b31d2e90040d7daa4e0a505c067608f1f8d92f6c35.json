    "explanation": "Janus RX is listed as a pharmacy with a local address and a dedicated website, but there is no indication it is part of a major chain, affiliated with a hospital, or a government facility. The name and available information suggest it is a privately-owned retail pharmacy serving the general public. There is no explicit mention of compounding services."
