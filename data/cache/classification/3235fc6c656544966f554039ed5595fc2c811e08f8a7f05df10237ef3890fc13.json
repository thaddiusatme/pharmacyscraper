    "explanation": "South Bend Specialty Pharmacy is categorized simply as a pharmacy without any indication of affiliation with a hospital or a large corporate chain. The name suggests a specialty focus but does not explicitly indicate compounding services, and there is no evidence it is part of a chain or hospital system, so it is classified as an independent pharmacy."
