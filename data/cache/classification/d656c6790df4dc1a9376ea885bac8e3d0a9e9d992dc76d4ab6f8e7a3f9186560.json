    "explanation": "Community Rx is categorized simply as a pharmacy without any indication of affiliation with a hospital, health system, or a major corporate chain. The website domain (ncmcla.com) suggests a local or regional community focus rather than a national chain. There is no mention of compounding services in the categories or website, so it is not classified as a compounding pharmacy."
