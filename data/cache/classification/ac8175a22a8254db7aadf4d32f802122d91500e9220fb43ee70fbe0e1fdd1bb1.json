    "explanation": "Genoa Healthcare is a well-known pharmacy provider that operates as part of a larger corporate chain specializing in pharmacy services, often serving institutional and community settings. There is no indication it is affiliated with a hospital or that it is an independent standalone retail pharmacy.
