    "explanation": "Ivywild Pharmacy is a retail pharmacy located at a standalone address with no indication of affiliation to a hospital, health system, or government facility. It is not part of a known corporate chain such as CVS or Walgreens. There is no mention of compounding services in its categories or website, so it is classified as an independent pharmacy without compounding."
