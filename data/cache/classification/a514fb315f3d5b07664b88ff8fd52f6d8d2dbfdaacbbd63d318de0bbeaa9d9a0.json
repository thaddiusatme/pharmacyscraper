    "explanation": "Newtown Square Pharmacy is listed on the website of Guardian Pharmacy, a known pharmacy chain (mygnp.com is Guardian's domain), indicating it is part of a corporate chain rather than an independent or hospital pharmacy. There is no mention of compounding services in the categories or website, so it is not classified as a compounding pharmacy."
