    "explanation": "Ladas Pharmacy is categorized simply as a pharmacy without any indication of affiliation with a large corporate chain or hospital system, nor is there mention of government or military ties. The absence of 'compounding' in its categories or name suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy. Therefore, it fits the profile of an independent retail pharmacy."
