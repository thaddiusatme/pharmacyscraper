    "explanation": "All In One Pharmacy appears to be a standalone retail pharmacy serving the general public without affiliation to a hospital or a known corporate chain. The website name 'legalpharmaceutics.com' does not explicitly indicate compounding services, and the categories list only 'Pharmacy' without mention of compounding, so it is likely not a compounding pharmacy."
