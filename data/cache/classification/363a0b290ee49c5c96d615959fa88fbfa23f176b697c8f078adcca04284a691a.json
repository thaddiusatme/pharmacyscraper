    "explanation": "Kinney Drugs Pharmacy is part of Kinney Drugs, a regional pharmacy chain operating multiple retail locations in New York and surrounding areas. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility, nor that it is an independent standalone pharmacy. The absence of 'compounding' in its name or categories suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy."
