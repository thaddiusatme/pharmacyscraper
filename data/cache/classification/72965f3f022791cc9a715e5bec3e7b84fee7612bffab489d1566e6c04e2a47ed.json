    "explanation": "Capitol Heights Pharmacy & Liquor appears to be a standalone retail business serving the general public, indicated by its combination of pharmacy and liquor store services and lack of affiliation with any known corporate chain or hospital system. The category 'Drug store' and the website suggest a retail pharmacy rather than a hospital or chain pharmacy. There is no mention of compounding services."
