    "explanation": "Peach Orchard Drugs is classified as an independent pharmacy because it does not appear to be part of a major corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. The association with HealthMart, a franchise model that supports independent pharmacies, further supports this classification. There is no indication that it is a compounding pharmacy or affiliated with a hospital."
