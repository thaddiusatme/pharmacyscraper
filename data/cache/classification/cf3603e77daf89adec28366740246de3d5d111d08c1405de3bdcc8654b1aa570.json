    "classification": "independent",

    "confidence": 0.85,
    "explanation": "The business name 'Kenneth A. Isaacs, BS' suggests an individual pharmacist rather than a corporate chain or hospital affiliation. The category 'Pharmacy' indicates it is a pharmacy, and there is no indication of compounding services or hospital/chain affiliation. The lack of a website and additional details lowers confidence slightly, but it fits the profile of an independent pharmacy."
