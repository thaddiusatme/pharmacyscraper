    "explanation": "Basinger's Pharmacy City Center is classified as an independent pharmacy because it does not appear to be part of a large corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility. The lack of compounding in its categories suggests it does not offer compounding services."
