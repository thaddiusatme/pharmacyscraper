    "confidence": 0.85,
    "explanation": "Powell's Northside Pharmacy appears to be an independent pharmacy as it is not listed as part of a major chain like CVS or Walgreens. The name suggests a local or family-owned business, and there is no indication of affiliation with a hospital or government facility. However, the confidence is not at its highest because the website link does not provide explicit information about its ownership or compounding services."
