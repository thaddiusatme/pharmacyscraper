    "explanation": "Bartell Drugs is a well-known regional pharmacy chain in the Pacific Northwest, operating multiple retail pharmacy locations. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility, nor that it is an independent standalone pharmacy. The absence of 'compounding' in its name or categories suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy."
