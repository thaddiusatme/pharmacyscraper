    "explanation": "Crosby's Drugs Inc. is classified as an independent pharmacy because it does not appear to be part of a large corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility. The lack of compounding services in the provided categories suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy."
