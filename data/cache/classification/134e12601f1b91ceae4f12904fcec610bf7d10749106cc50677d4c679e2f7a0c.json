    "explanation": "True Care Pharmacy is listed simply as a pharmacy without any indication of affiliation with a hospital, health system, or a large corporate chain. Its website and name do not suggest it is part of a chain or hospital, nor does it mention compounding services, so it is classified as an independent retail pharmacy without compounding."
