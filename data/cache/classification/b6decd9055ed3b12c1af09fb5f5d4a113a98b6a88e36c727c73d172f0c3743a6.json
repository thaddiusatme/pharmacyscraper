    "explanation": "Lynn's Dakotamart Pharmacy appears to be a standalone retail pharmacy serving the general public without affiliation to a major corporate chain or hospital system. The name and website indicate it is a local pharmacy rather than part of a large chain like CVS or Walgreens, and there is no mention of hospital or government affiliation. There is also no indication that it specializes in compounding services."
