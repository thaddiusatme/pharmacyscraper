    "confidence": 0.9,
    "explanation": "The name 'Bass Pro Shops Family Health Center Pharmacy' suggests it is a pharmacy located within or affiliated with a health center inside a Bass Pro Shops facility, which is primarily a retail outdoor goods store, not a traditional pharmacy chain or independent pharmacy. Without evidence of it being part of a hospital or health system, it is likely a retail health service point but not a standalone pharmacy business. The lack of compounding indication and the unusual context lowers confidence slightly."
