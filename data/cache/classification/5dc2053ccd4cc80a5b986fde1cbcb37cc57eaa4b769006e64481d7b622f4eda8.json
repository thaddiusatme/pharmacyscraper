    "classification": "independent",

    "confidence": 0.9,
    "explanation": "Hieber's Pharmacy appears to be an independent pharmacy as it is not part of a well-known corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility. However, without explicit information about its ownership or compounding services, the confidence is slightly lower."
