    "explanation": "The Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy is a retail pharmacy brand that operates as a network of independently owned and operated pharmacies, not part of a large corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication it is affiliated with a hospital or medical system, nor is it a government facility. The category and website do not mention compounding services, so it is not classified as a compounding pharmacy."
