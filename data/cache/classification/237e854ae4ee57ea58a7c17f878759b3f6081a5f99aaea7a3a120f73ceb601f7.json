    "explanation": "Medly Pharmacy, formerly Pharmaca Integrative Pharmacy, is part of Medly, a known pharmacy chain operating multiple locations. There is no indication that it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility, nor that it is an independent standalone business. The absence of 'compounding' in its name or categories suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy."
