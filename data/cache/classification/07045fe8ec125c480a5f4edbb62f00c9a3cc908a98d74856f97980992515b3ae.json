    "explanation": "MADINA PHARMACY INC. is categorized simply as a pharmacy with no indication of affiliation to a large corporate chain or hospital system, nor is there mention of government or military ties. The absence of 'compounding' in its name or categories suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy. Therefore, it fits the criteria of an independent retail pharmacy."
