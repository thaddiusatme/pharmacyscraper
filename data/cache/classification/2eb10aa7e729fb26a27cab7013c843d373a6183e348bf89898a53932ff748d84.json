    "explanation": "The name 'Dale Menges, RPHD' suggests an individual pharmacist or a small private practice rather than a corporate chain or hospital-affiliated pharmacy. There is no indication of affiliation with a hospital, health system, or government facility, nor is there mention of compounding services. The category 'Pharmacy' alone supports it being a retail pharmacy likely independent."
