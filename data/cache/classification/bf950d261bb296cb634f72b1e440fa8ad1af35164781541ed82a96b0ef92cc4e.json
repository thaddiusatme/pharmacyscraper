    "explanation": "Oneworld Health Mart Pharmacy is part of the Health Mart network, which is a franchise-like group of independently owned pharmacies rather than a corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. It is not affiliated with a hospital or government facility, and there is no indication of compounding services in its name or categories, so it fits the definition of an independent retail pharmacy."
