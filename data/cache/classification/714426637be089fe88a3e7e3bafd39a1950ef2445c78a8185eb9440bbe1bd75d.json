    "explanation": "We Care Products is described as a homeopathic pharmacy, which typically indicates a retail pharmacy specializing in alternative or natural remedies rather than being part of a large chain or hospital system. There is no indication it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility, nor is it a known corporate chain. The website domain suggests a focus on CBD or alternative products rather than compounding customized medications, so it is not classified as a compounding pharmacy."
