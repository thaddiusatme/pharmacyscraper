    "explanation": "Gateway Medical Pharmacy is described as a 'Long Term Care and Compounding Pharmacy' and does not appear to be part of a large corporate chain or affiliated with a hospital or government facility. The presence of 'Compounding Pharmacy' in the name and its service focus indicates it customizes medications, confirming it as a compounding pharmacy.
