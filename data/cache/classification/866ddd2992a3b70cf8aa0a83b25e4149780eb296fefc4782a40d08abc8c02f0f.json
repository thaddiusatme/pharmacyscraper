    "explanation": "Credena Health Pharmacy Sacred Heart appears to be a retail pharmacy serving the general public and is not identified as part of a large corporate chain or hospital system. The name includes 'Sacred Heart,' which might suggest a hospital affiliation, but the website URL (cornerdrugstore.com) and lack of hospital or health system categorization indicate it operates as an independent pharmacy. There is no mention of compounding services in the categories or website."
