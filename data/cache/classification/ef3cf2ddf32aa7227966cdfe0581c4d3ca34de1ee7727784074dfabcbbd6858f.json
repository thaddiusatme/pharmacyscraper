    "explanation": "VCare Discount Pharmacy appears to be an independent pharmacy as it does not match any well-known chain names like CVS or Walgreens. However, the website link to HealthMart, which is a network of independent pharmacies, suggests it might be part of a larger network but not a traditional chain. There is no indication of compounding services."
