    "explanation": "Pilsen Pharmacy is categorized simply as a pharmacy with no indication of affiliation with a large corporate chain or hospital system, nor is there evidence it is part of a government facility. The absence of 'compounding' in its categories or name suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy. Therefore, it fits the criteria of an independent retail pharmacy."
