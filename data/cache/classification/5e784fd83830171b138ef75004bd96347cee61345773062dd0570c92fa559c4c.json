    "confidence": 0.85,
    "explanation": "The Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy is likely an independent pharmacy because it is not explicitly part of a major chain like CVS or Walgreens. However, it is part of a franchise system, which might slightly reduce confidence in its classification as purely independent. There is no indication that it is a compounding pharmacy or affiliated with a hospital."
