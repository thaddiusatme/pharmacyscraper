    "explanation": "Beattie's Healthmart Pharmacy is a retail pharmacy operating under the Healthmart brand, which is a network of independently owned pharmacies rather than a corporate chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication it is affiliated with a hospital or government facility. The website and categories do not mention compounding services, so it is not classified as a compounding pharmacy."
