    "explanation": "JERSEY MEDS PHARMACY is listed simply as a pharmacy without any indication of affiliation with a hospital, government facility, or a large corporate chain. Its website and name do not suggest it is part of a chain or hospital system, nor does it explicitly mention compounding services, so it is classified as an independent pharmacy without compounding."
