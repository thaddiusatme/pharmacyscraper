    "explanation": "Genoa Healthcare is primarily a pharmacy services provider specializing in behavioral health and long-term care, often embedded within clinics or health centers rather than operating as a traditional retail, chain, or hospital pharmacy. Its business model and website suggest it does not fit the standard definitions of independent, chain, or hospital pharmacy, and it is not a standalone retail pharmacy."
