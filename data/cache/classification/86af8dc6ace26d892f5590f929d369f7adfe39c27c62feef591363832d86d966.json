    "explanation": "Friendly Pharmacy is described as being inside Extra Supermarket, which suggests it is a retail pharmacy serving the general public but not part of a large corporate pharmacy chain like CVS or Walgreens. There is no indication it is affiliated with a hospital or medical system, nor is there mention of compounding services in its categories or website, so it is classified as an independent retail pharmacy without compounding."
