    "explanation": "MLK Pharmacy is categorized simply as a pharmacy with no indication of affiliation to a hospital, clinic, government facility, or a known corporate chain. The absence of 'compounding' in its categories or name suggests it is not a compounding pharmacy. Therefore, it fits the criteria of an independent retail pharmacy."
