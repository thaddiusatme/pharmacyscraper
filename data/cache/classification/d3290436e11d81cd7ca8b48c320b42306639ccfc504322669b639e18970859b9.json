    "explanation": "Ivira Pharmacy is listed simply as a pharmacy without any indication of affiliation with a hospital, health system, or a major corporate chain. The website and categories do not mention compounding services, and the name does not suggest it is part of a chain or hospital, so it is classified as an independent retail pharmacy."
