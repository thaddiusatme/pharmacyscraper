    "explanation": "Beach Street Pharmacy is listed on the Good Neighbor Pharmacy website, which is a network of independently owned pharmacies affiliated with a larger cooperative but often considered part of a chain network rather than fully independent. There is no indication it is hospital-affiliated or government-run, and no mention of compounding services on the listing."
