    "explanation": "North Star Pharmacy & Infusion appears to be a standalone retail pharmacy serving the general public, not affiliated with any large corporate chain or hospital system. Although the name includes 'Infusion,' there is no explicit indication that it is a compounding pharmacy. The website suggests specialized infusion services but does not emphasize compounding, supporting classification as an independent pharmacy without compounding."
