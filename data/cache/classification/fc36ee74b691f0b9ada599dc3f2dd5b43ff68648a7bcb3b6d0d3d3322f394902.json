    "explanation": "The name 'Grove Pharmacy Glenstone -- CLOSED, now APO Pharmacy' suggests it was a retail pharmacy location that has since been replaced by APO Pharmacy, which is a known pharmacy chain. There is no indication it was affiliated with a hospital or a government facility, nor is there mention of compounding services. The closure and replacement by a chain pharmacy supports classification as a chain pharmacy with moderate-high confidence."
