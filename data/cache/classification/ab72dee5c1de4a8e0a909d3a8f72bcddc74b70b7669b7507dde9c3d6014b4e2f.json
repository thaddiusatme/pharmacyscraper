    "explanation": "The name 'Coalition Family Health Center & Pharmacy' and its address on Medical Arts Ct suggest it is affiliated with a health center or clinic rather than being a standalone retail pharmacy. This indicates it is a hospital or clinic-affiliated pharmacy rather than an independent or chain retail pharmacy. There is no indication of compounding services."
