    "explanation": "The name 'Jersey City Pharmacy' suggests a pharmacy, but the website provided (cityofjerseycity.org) is the official municipal government site for Jersey City, not a retail or hospital pharmacy. There is no indication this is a standalone or chain pharmacy or a hospital-affiliated pharmacy, so it is classified as not a pharmacy."
