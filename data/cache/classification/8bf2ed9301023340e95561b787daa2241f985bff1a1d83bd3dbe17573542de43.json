    "explanation": "Sterling Pharmacy is listed as a pharmacy without any indication of affiliation with a large corporate chain or hospital system. The website URL suggests it is part of a local or regional pharmacy group (mygnp.com), which is not a major national chain, and there is no mention of compounding services in the categories or website. Therefore, it fits the criteria of an independent retail pharmacy."
